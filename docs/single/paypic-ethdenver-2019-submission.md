# Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
Tired of always being asked to take a photo of people and receiving NOTHING but thanks? Impose some rules on this world and demand cold hard crypto for your mastery of group-portrait composition.

Status extension takes a photograph and uploads it as base64 to a small server, which saves the image as a file and returns a unique public URL. The uploader's extension then saves that URL and sends it as a command parameter to the buyer's extension instance.

# Describe your tech stack (e.g., protocols, languages, API’s, etc.)

- Status Extensions - Hiccup
- NodeJS HTTP Server - JavaScript

** Requires the nightly build of Status, and image sending does not work from android **
