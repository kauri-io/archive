# Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
CypherPress is a framework that lets you build decentralised databases for your organisation, team or even public. Your users will have control over who can access their data without a central authority managing those permissions.

 An application of our platform would be to build a Dapp for doctors and patients in a hospital - where patients can decide who they want to share their medical history with.

Another application could be to build a 'decentralised-dropbox'.

# Describe your tech stack (e.g., protocols, languages, API’s, etc.)
Nucypher's API - for layer2 privacy 

IPFS - our decentralised storage service 

ReactNative - our front-end framework 

Flask - our python server to interact with nucypher's API 

Remix - for writing ethereum smart contracts

Ganache-Cli - for creating local RPC client for testing our Dapp

Infura - for connecting to an IPFS node
