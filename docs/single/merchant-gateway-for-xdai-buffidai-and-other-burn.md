Merchant is a point of sales system that enables small business to accept xDai, BuffyDai, and any other currency. Users simply create a menu of sellable goods and Merchant will automatically generate QR codes for complex orders. Want to buy a double bufficorn latte with two pumps of vanilla and three shots of espresso? No problem, Merchant has you covered!

## Describe your tech stack (e.g., protocols, languages, API’s, etc.)

React.js on top of bootstrap frontend and web3.js over the xDai/BuffyDai POA network.


## Track for which you’re submitting (Open or Impact)

Open.

Note: I initially selected "Impact" thinking that was for the specific bounties, I now realize that we fall more in the open category.


## All Bounties Completed/Incorporated

MakerDAO Bounty #1: Improve the burner wallet!

Note: While this project is more of an extension to the burner wallet, we asked MakerDAO directly and were told it would qualify for consideration of this bounty.
