*Hacker*: Someone who takes part in the hackathon by joining a team and working on a project, and the term
doesn't exclusively refer to people with software development backgrounds.

#### Commitment to Using Dapps
Or "If you liked it then you shoulda put a dApp on it"!

ETHBerlin will try to use tools created within the ecosystem as much as possible for its various needs.
This paves the way for adoption of web3, which we're all trying to buidl, and acts as a good
testing ground for the dapps, consequently helping the respective teams to learn from this experience
and make the softwares even better.
For more on this, check out the [article](https://medium.com/ethberlin/if-you-liked-it-then-you-shoulda-put-a-dapp-on-it-626b032d32a5).

#### Communication Channel
One of the dapps, mentioned above, that we love and use a lot, is [Status](https://status.im/). Make sure you install it
and come say hi in the [#ethberlin](https://get.status.im/chat/public/ethberlin) channel. Feel free to ask for
couches there, or discuss sharing flat with other participants. We also have channels for getting to know eachother
and building teams!

### Preparation and Planning
*For everyone*

We're really excited that you're joining us. Here are the next steps:

#### Getting to Berlin
[Here](https://www.berlin.de/en/airports-and-stations/) you can find information about the airports and stations in Berlin.
Unfortunately ETHBerlin is not able to compensate traveling costs of participants as funding is limited
and we've decided to allocate the biggest fraction of the funds to the prize pool and organizations of
the events itself. However, there is a very limited subsidy on a first-come first-served basis. We encourage
everyone to allow those who benefit most make use of these subsidies. To apply please write [us](joinus@ethberlin.com).

#### Accommodation
There are a variety of options available in Berlin for the purpose of accomodation. From hostels to
airbnb flats and hotels. We recommend the regions Treptow, Kreuzberg or Friedrichshain due to their 
close proximity to the venue.
As part of our commitment to using dapps extensively throughout the hackathon, we're in close contact
with the team behind [Winding Tree](https://windingtree.com/), and most probably they will launch to
mainnet within the next few days, in which case, you can reserve a place with ETH or LIF, their native token.

#### Venues
Day 1 (7. September) consists of a two-track conference in *two* venues:

- **Factory Mitte** (Rheinsberger Straße 76/77)
- **Factory Görlitzer Park** (Lohmühlenstraße 65)

After the conferences are done, the hackathon people will get together at **Factory Görlitzer** – this will be the *only venue* after the conferences – at 22:00 when the opening ceremony (accompanied by dinner & drinks) and team formation will take place. The Hackathon kicks off at 00:00 on September 8th.

#### Tickets
If you are a hacker, a mentor, a registered sponsor, a volunteer, a judge or a speaker you don’t need a ticket, just your e-mail confirmation and ID.

Community tickets for Day 1 conferences will be launched via Peepeth on a Blockparty Smart Contract on September 1st. All tickets are free. Community tickets do *not* enable access to the Hackathon or Day 2 & 3 Workshops. Thank you in advance for respecting the hackers and their #BUIDL.

### The Event

#### Schedule
- [**Full Schedule**](https://ethberlin.com/schedule/) includes first-day conference tracks, workshops during the hackathon, etc.
- [**Hackathon Schedule**](https://ethberlin.com/hackathon-schedule) includes key hackathon events (registeration, etc.) and mealtimes.

#### Food and Stuff
ETHBerlin will cover all meals & drinks for the entire Hackathon, and conference coffee breaks. you won’t need money here, only BERLINcoin to experiment with, an open mind, a knowledge-thirsty brain & sharp-as-knives building skills. 

#### Sleeping Facilities
Due to the regulations of the venue, unfortunately we cannot offer any sleeping facilities on-site, and
sleeping bags are not allowed. Please make sure you take this into consideration when choosing an accomodation.
