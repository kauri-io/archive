## Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
NABU is a token system that introduces cryptocurrency to the higher education system. Students can earn NABU (the NABU token) based on their performance in their classes on a weekly basis. Tokens can be used to pay for school expenses, like tuition, books, supplies and more. Ultimately, we hope to introduce NABU internationally so students can donate their excess tokens to fund the education of others in need.

## Describe your tech stack (e.g., protocols, languages, API’s, etc.)
Smart contract controlling NABU token interaction implemented in Solidity (ERC20 standard), deployed to POA core network. 
Cross-platform angular app developed using ionic framework with typescript, using web3 for smart contract interaction.
University software developed with web3.js used for interacting with the deployed smart contract.
