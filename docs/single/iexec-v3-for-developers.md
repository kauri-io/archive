## iExec V3 for developers

The V3 of iExec was released on May 15, 2019. Here's a list of useful resources if you want to build on iExec as an app or data provider. This is the [official documentation](https://docs.iex.ec/), it's definitely the best place to get started. This is the '[quick start](https://docs.iex.ec/quickstart.html')' section if you're in a hurry.  

You can talk to the dev team through one of the following channels: 

- Gitter: https://gitter.im/iExecBlockchainComputing/Lobby
- Slack: https://slack.iex.ec/
- Email: support@iex.ec

### Deploy your app 

To get inspired, here's the [iexec-apps](https://github.com/iExecBlockchainComputing/iexec-apps) repo where you will find quasi all V3-ready apps. By the way, you can register your app on the [Dapp Store](https://dapps.iex.ec/), and we now have a [Data Store](https://data.iex.ec/) to monetize your datasets.

[CloudCoinAnalysis](https://github.com/iExecBlockchainComputing/apps/tree/master/CloudCoinAnalysis) is a good example on what can be done with iExec.

### CLI and JS library

- [JS Library](https://github.com/iExecBlockchainComputing/iexec-sdk#iexec-sdk-library-api)
- [CLI API](https://github.com/iExecBlockchainComputing/iexec-sdk#sdk-cli-for-dapp-developpers)

### Add a dataset

We're developing several templates for iExec dapps. [NSFW App](https://nsfw.app.iex.ec/) is one of these. [This video](https://youtu.be/HA8pgMgr3u8) shows the user workflow.

Here's how to deploy and monetize your dataset thanks to iExec:
