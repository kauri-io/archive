## Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
Buy, trade or win the ingredients for brewing beer (yeast, barley, hops, and the brewery) in this **gnutterly unique implementation of ERC721 tokens** that lets you redeem your collectibles for **real beer** from real breweries.  This ain't no cat-lady game - this is for real Gnus who want their hard earned scrilla to pay them back in suds while they take their mates' cards off them in ***head-to-head game-theory battles.***  Yes - you read that right, it's Rock Paper Scissors, Beer, and African wildebeests on the blockchain. The first brewery is the Low Down, just 2 blocks from the Sports Castle.  Don't be a cat lady - be a Gnu brewmaster!
