# Witnet Monthly Report — August 2018



Greetings, Witnet community! As planned, every month we update you on our work towards the milestones 
[set in our project roadmap](https://republic.co/witnet)
 . We share with you this monthly update a bit later than expected because we wanted to include 
**a recap of our first milestone: the Witnet prototype, Sheikah**.

### 💜 Team
Over the course of August 
[we’ve introduced you to James](https://medium.com/witnet/team-insights-james-witnets-community-lead-3e86df746073), 
**our new Community Lead.**
 James has experience in the blockchain industry, as 
**he has worked with BlockApps, Consensys and Metamask,**
 and will now work closely with smart contract developers so they can make the most out of the Witnet decentralized oracle network.
 
**The Witnet Foundation still has** [open positions](https://angel.co/witnet-foundation-1/jobs), so if you are aware of the impact a decentralized oracle network will have on the crypto landscape and want to get involved, be sure to check them out!

### 🔧 Product

#### Sheikah prototype
Last week we announced the Sheikah prototype! Sheikah is a lightweight Electron app which 
**will eventually serve as a full interface**
 for the Witnet wallet, data requests, smart contracts, block explorer, and more.
While the full Witnet testnet and subsequent main-net are yet-to-come on our development roadmap, 
**we wanted to give our community a good idea of what interacting with the Witnet decentralized oracle network**
 would feel like. You can go through the technology preview 
[in this blog post](https://medium.com/witnet/welcome-to-sheikah-5b658d4815c8)
