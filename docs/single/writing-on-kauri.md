# Writing on Kauri


Welcome to Kauri, we're excited to help you share your knowledge across the world via the Ethereum ecosystem.

We've tried to make contributing as smooth as possible, but since Kauri is in beta, contact us with comments, concerns, criticism, or any form of feedback by emailing <mailto:info@kauri.io>.

Now on to the good stuff.

### Download and Configure Metamask

[Metamask](https://metamask.io) is a browser extension that gives you access to your Ethereum accounts in the browser. Add the MetaMask extension to your browser and follow the setup instructions. Set MetaMask to the "Rinkeby" network when using Kauri.

### Sign In to Kauri

Kauri uses Metamask to associate your posts with an Ethereum address and allow for bounties to be paid for your posts. Click the _Sign In_ button beneath the profile picture in the top right, and click _Sign_ on the MetaMask popup to complete the process (this is not a transaction, and doesn't cost you any ETH).

### Edit Your Profile

While not required, adding profile details gives readers extra details about you, and adds a username to your articles. Kauri keeps your email address private, and we use it for notifications.

### Profile Page

The first page of your profile displays your account details and three sub-sections.

-   _Articles_: Your published articles.
-   _Collections_: The article collections you created.
-   _Manage_:
    -   _Drafts_: Your unpublished draft articles.
    -   _Awaiting Approval_: Changes to your articles awaiting approval by you.
    -   _Submitted Updates_: Changes you submitted to other articles waiting approval by their owner
    -   _Pending Transfers_: Shows
    -   _Communities_: The communities you manage and moderated by others awaiting your approval.

### Writing an Article

To write an article, select _Contribute_ in the top right corner, and click _Write Article_ from the drop-down.

Clicking this button takes you to the editor interface. The editor supports Markdown and has a rich-text menu if you're new to Markdown or have forgotten any of the syntax. You can find a helpful Markdown cheatsheet [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

#### Images

You can upload PNG, GIF or JPEG images of up to 10 MB in size from the editor toolbar using the image button. This uploads the image to [IPFS](https://IPFS.io) and creates a markdown image tag with the URL auto-filled.

If you have an image already hosted elsewhere you want to use, create the markdown image tag manually.

#### Video

You can't upload videos to Kauri, but to embed videos hosted elsewhere, click the video button in the editor toolbar, paste the video into the popup box and an HTML embed tag is created for you.

#### Preview tab

If you want to preview the final content, select the _Preview_ tab.

#### Metadata tab

The _Metadata_ tab lets you set a "[canonical URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_link_element)" for content that is a duplicate of content elsewhere.

#### Import tab

The _Import_ tab lets you import content from other web sites, this is a beta feature, if you have feedback or recommendations [let us know](mailto:info@kauri.io).

#### Save article

When you're finished, you can save the article as a draft using the _Save as Draft_ button, or publish with the _Publish Article_ button. If you choose to save a draft of the article, you can return to it anytime in from the _Manage -> Drafts_ section of your profile. Publishing the article makes it appear in your public profile.

#### Tags

Tagging your content correctly helps readers find what they are looking for on Kauri. You can add between one and seven tags to an article. Add tags by starting to type the relevant term, and selecting it from the autocomplete list, or hit enter to save a new tab.

### Updating articles

One of the core principles of Kauri is keeping content up-to-date and usable, and you can update any articles you've written whenever you want.

To update an article, first, open it. On the top toolbar of the article is an _Edit Article_ button. This button returns you to the editor, where you can make changes.

If it's content you own, or content in a community you are an admin in, then you publish the changes as soon as you click _Publish Article_.

If you want to suggest changes to articles owned by other writers, click _Suggest Edit_ on the top toolbar. Your suggested changes and comments wait for the owner to view, approve, and publish when they click _Approve Changes_.

You also have the option of saving the article as a draft, but this creates a new version of the article with a new ID, and the old one still exists.

### Claim an Article by Submitting it On-chain

Submitting an article on-chain claims it as yours in a transaction on the Ethereum Blockchain.

Click the _Submit Article to On-Chain_ button at the bottom of an article.
