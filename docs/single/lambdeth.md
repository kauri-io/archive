# Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
This project is a low level functional library written for Solidity that includes functions that are designed to save the time of building with multiple, complex loops when writing a Solidity contract. It is written as a separate contract that is deployed to the blockchain and callable by any other contract on the Ethereum chain. We plan to continue to add to and maintain this library to provide better functionality to everyone writing in Solidity.

# Describe your tech stack (e.g., protocols, languages, API’s, etc.)
We wrote this library on Solidity, with Solidity, using ZeppelinOS and Truffle. We tested the library with Solidity and Javascript.
