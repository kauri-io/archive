## The Kauri Archive

Kauri was an open, Web3 based platform, created with the goal to foster the spread of Ethereum development knowledge far and wide.

Kauri in its current form has been deactivated, but the content posted on the platform by our community was invaluable, so we're hosting everything here, so that these articles are still accessible.

We hope that you find the content useful!
