# Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
It is now easy to spin up devnets (PoW and/or PoA) with fully integrated analytics across chains with Splunk. All the logs, metrics, and even ledger data are automatically indexed into a local Splunk deployment. This enables devs to achieve  4 levels of Operational Intelligence: search and investigate issues with Dapps and/or infrastructure, become proactive by monitoring and alerting, break down silos and gain operational visibility across chains, finally get real-time business insights by combining on-chain and off-chain data.

# Describe your tech stack (e.g., protocols, languages, API’s, etc.)
Splunk: data search and visualization
Geth + Docker: talking to Ethereum
POA: for xDai and multi-chain analysis
Node: for javascript

# Track for which you’re submitting (Open or Impact)
Open

# All Bounties Completed/Incorporated
POA Bounty 1 Overview: Deploy on POA or xDai!
Ethereum Foundation Bounty 2 Overview: Most creative use of transaction throughput
