# Kauri celebrates 500th post


Ten days ago [Kevin Small](https://kauri.io/public-profile/043f19855cc8b31941f72d4728a4d32c0476a70d) posted [Visualizing Bitcoin Transactions in 3D and Virtual Reality](https://kauri.io/article/ef32ddae59094e8b99c92131b9148200), making it the 500th post submitted to Kauri. We thought this was a great time to recap and recount some of our and your favorite posts from the past year since Kauri began.

Unsurprisingly [our collections for the ETHDenver hackathon](https://kauri.io/search-results?q=ethdenver) attracted a lot of views, so we removed those from this wrap-up, but if you haven't seen them yet, take a look, there were some great submissions.

[Our full stack dapp collection](https://kauri.io/collection/5b8e401ee727370001c942e3/full-stack-dapp-tutorial-series) remains our most popular content, and we have periodically updated it to keep the content fresh. Second to that collection, our post "[What is Ethereum](https://kauri.io/article/67a81d8746ee4b49ba19447e8e2a983e/v7/ethereum-101-part-1-what-is-ethereum)" remains our single most popular post (from the [Ethereum 101](https://kauri.io/collection/5bb65f0f4f34080001731dc2/ethereum-101) collection), showing that people are still keen to learn how to get started developing for Ethereum.

Our wonderful intern, Juliette Rocco published a wide variety of beginners content, and [her public profile](/public-profile/dd23401dcab425f0a435eb7a86c77c5e8513bead) is one of our most popular landing pages, obviously people trying to find all her wonderful content 👏.

A recent post that people loved was from [Michael A](https://kauri.io/public-profile/2e34cdb393c08086e759e3d186b3b4fb2ca5b1b2) on [Ethereum community and its ecosystem: Networks Visualisation Analysis](https://kauri.io/article/cd37b69782ee45d6a96caa6e1ab43f42).

Finally, [Antoine Toulme](https://kauri.io/public-profile/c82a6220398714f74e2d929309f4c5b1d4f7b0f6)'s post on [getting started with Quorum](https://kauri.io/article/97e916abb4b5431bbb297f42d0ce8b88/quorum-how-to) rounds off our most popular content list.
